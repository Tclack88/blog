This process is just starting, so I'm not necessarily sure what will become of this blog page.

The posts aren't necessarily static; the dates will remain as the original post date, but the content may change to reflect: updates to the code, clearer explanations, extra content, or style changes as things become more 'standardized'. I'll try not to edit them too much to preserve a bit of history.

You can find all the code I've written on my github account
{% include icon-github.html username="Tclack88" %}, not all of which will make it here.
