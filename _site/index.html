	    PLOT UPDATED WEEKLY. I didn't really want to talk about the Corona Virus. Not because it's a particularly depressing topic to me, but because it's what *everyone* is talking about and epidemiology is not really a subject that interests me. But the media's portrayal of the data as just raw numbers doesn't get a good message across. Further, it doesn't tell us what we should focus on. I hope with this post I can reframe the data in a more enlightening way

	    The Trash Panda is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to make proper recycling easy and quick. Recycling can be confusing in part due to the variation in local laws. Some areas accept plastic bags in their curbside bins while others do not. Most of us know (or should know) that paint is hazardous and can't be tossed in the trash, but it can be annoying to look it up. Even worse, individuals who over recycle, putting everything even remotely plastic in their recycle bin and so unintentionally make poor decisions

The passenger window smashed and my backpack holding my laptop, among other things, was taken. This sucked for sure, however it inspired me to write this series of scripts and protocols so that if it were to ever happen again (to me or anyone), it might be possible to locate (exactly) the laptop even without a built-in GPS, simultaneously gather evidence for the authorities

	    I used to do Crossfit. I was stationed in New York state for post-bootcamp training and we were provided access to the local YMCA. I took advantage of the free membership and followed the 2-days-on-1-day-off regimen as RX'd by the main Crossfit website. I did this for about a year and a half, but it got hard to be consistent when I transferred to a ship. At the time you would log your workouts in the comment section of the post, so I could go back to any date and search my name. I had always wanted to go back and grab off my posts for my own records just in case they were to get archived or something. One day I realized I could automate this searching and that's where this program comes in.

	    In my Junior year at UCSB, I joined Music Connection, a club that would get together on weekends to play music to local retirement centers and homeless shelters. The number of members was large enough and their school schedules varied such that each week, a different subset of people from the group would go, so it wasn't the same group each time. To facilitate the rideshare process, we would assign one person to contact everyone on that week's signup list to ensure everyone would have a ride. It can be quite the undertaking for that person to contact everyone on the gig list, find out their addresses, check who's driving, and establish a pickup point. What follows is a means of automating that process
