I"å<p>Hey Julien, I hope you check back here, Iâ€™m working on editing the code to make it â€œOS neutralâ€, something I wasnâ€™t concerned with way back when I wrote this the first time.</p>

<p>I say that I hope you check back because I realize I havenâ€™t enabled email alerts yet to responses on this blog (Iâ€™m not very good at web stuff). I hope to get you a working Windows executable and to get these comment reply emails working within in the next few days. Best regards :]</p>
