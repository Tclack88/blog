```python
from cliches import *
print("Hello World!")
```

Excuse the stereotypical introduction, it's tradition.

## Who am I

At the time of writing, I have recently graduated with my B.S. in physics from the [University of California Santa Barbara][UCSB] where I became hopelessly overwhelmed by the amount of information there is. But it's also filled with unfathomably gifted people among whom I will never walk. But that's alright with me; I'm content being minimally competent with several skills rather than specializing in just a few. My perceptions have changed so much in the past decade. I thought with enough tenacity I could learn it all and I tried for [about 6 years][SuperMemo]. Chemistry, Geology, Math, Astronomy... I consumed as much as I could and regularly reviewed. It eventually became too much to keep up with, not withstanding the pressure to keep up with my degree requirements so I relented.

```python
print(cliche.two_types_of_people)
```
>*"There are two types of people in the world:*<br/>
> *mechanics and mechanical engineers"* <br/>

### Little more about me
I've gained and lost many hobbies and micro-hobbies over the years, but the ones that seem to be staying are: Rock climbing, piano and coding. I can speak French decently well and my Spanish is alright. I'm intrigued by all things arcane: Morse code, Elian script, unit conversions(there are 4 pecks in a bushel), interesting vocab words, etc. I'm pedantic to a fault and I hate driving, especially because that's when random questions come to mind and I can't (safely/legally) google them. This is starting to get a little personal, so let's switch gears.

## Purpose
```python
def purpose():
	While True:
	pass
```

I intend to use this outlet to speak about the code I've written &mdash; particularly inspiration for its conception, lessons learned during the process and some relevant/interesting background information. I'm not not really an expert at anything and won't feign to be a guru, but there may be some room for tutorials here, or at the very least my interpretation of grotesque, overly technical subjects as I come to understand them during my own learning process. Hopefully this will be a productive use of webspace. I don't care for personal blogs, but such material may slip in from time to time, so I apologize in advance. 

Ultimately, I wish to leave the world a better condition than when I arrived. As such, I intend to do what I can to reduce global emissions be it through contributions to renewable energy technologies or by reducing wasted energy by working on energy efficiency projects.

But enough of this, let's start digging in to the details.
