<p>Excuse the stereotypical introduction, it‚Äôs tradition.</p>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, I have recently graduated with my B.S. in physics from the <a href="https://ucsb.edu">University of California Santa Barbara</a> where I became hopelessly overwhelmed by the amount of information there is. But it‚Äôs also filled with unfathomably gifted people among whom I will never walk. But that‚Äôs alright with me; I‚Äôm content being minimally competent with several skills rather than specializing in just a few. My perceptions have changed so much in the past decade. I thought with enough tenacity I could learn it all and I tried for <a href="https://supermemo.com">about 6 years</a>. Chemistry, Geology, Math, Astronomy‚Ä¶ I consumed as much as I could and regularly reviewed. It eventually became too much to keep up with, not withstanding the pressure to keep up with my degree requirements so I relented.</p>

  <p><em>‚ÄúThere are two types of people in the world:</em><br />
<em>mechanics and mechanical engineers‚Äù</em> <br />
What do I mean by that? I think we retain a lot more by doing rather than studying formally. The latter is certainly important, but I‚Äôve spent so much of my life learning theory and not applying it. <br />
(Perhaps it would have been a more productive 6 years if I had turned to DIY projects more often than textbooks.)</p>

<h3 id="little-more-about-me">Little more about me</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve gained and lost many hobbies and micro-hobbies over the years, but the ones that seem to be staying are: Rock climbing, piano and coding. I can speak French decently well and my Spanish is alright. I‚Äôm intrigued by all things arcane: Morse code, Elian script, unit conversions(there are 4 pecks in a bushel), interesting vocab words, etc. I‚Äôm pedantic to a fault and I hate driving, especially because that‚Äôs when random questions come to mind and I can‚Äôt (safely/legally) google them. This is starting to get a little personal, so let‚Äôs switch gears.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">purpose</span><span class="p">():</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I intend to use this outlet to speak about the code I‚Äôve written ‚Äî particularly inspiration for its conception, lessons learned during the process and some relevant/interesting background information. I‚Äôm not not really an expert at anything and won‚Äôt feign to be a guru, but there may be some room for tutorials here, or at the very least my interpretation of grotesque, overly technical subjects as I come to understand them during my own learning process. Hopefully this will be a productive use of webspace. I don‚Äôt care for personal blogs, but such material may slip in from time to time, so I apologize in advance.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I wish to leave the world a better condition than when I arrived. As such, I intend to do what I can to reduce global emissions be it through contributions to renewable energy technologies or by reducing wasted energy by working on energy efficiency projects.</p>

<p>But enough of this, let‚Äôs start digging in to the details.</p>
