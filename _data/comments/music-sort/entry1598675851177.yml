message: "Hey Julien, I hope you check back here, I'm working on editing the code to make it \"OS neutral\", something I wasn't concerned with way back when I wrote this the first time.\r\n\r\nI say that I hope you check back because I realize I haven't enabled email alerts yet to responses on this blog (I'm not very good at web stuff). I hope to get you a working Windows executable and to get these comment reply emails working within in the next few days. Best regards :]"
