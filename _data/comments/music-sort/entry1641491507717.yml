  I just found this program as my daughter found her old 30GB Ipod and wanted to
  get all the content removed so she could use it on other devices. This little
  program worked great, after I had a little help from the creator, I'm not to
  swift with computers. Anyway great help and a super program for listing all
  content and converting to MP3 format.
